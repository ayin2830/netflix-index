This project is based on The Economist's Big Mac Index but instead of using Big Macs, here I used Netflix Subscription rates (standard) from different countries. 

## A little economics lesson: Purchasing-power parity and the Big Mac Index

This Netflix Index is based on The Economist's Big Mac Index. The Big Mac Index is an economic index that analyzes two currencies' purchasing power by comparing the price of the Big Mac in different countries.

This index is based on the Purchasing-Power Parity theory, which is a metric that uses a "basket of goods" method to compare the currencies of various nations.This enables us to compare discrepancies in customer purchasing power around the world.

Why did they choose to use the Big Mac as comparison? Because the Big Mac is available almost everywhere in the world and is very consistent. It is compromised of the same ingredients, cooked in the same way, made with identical ingredients, but in different economies. In the same way, a Netflix offers essentially the same service around the globe. 


## What is the objective behind this project?
Since this is my first project, I wanted to keep it simple, but engaging. I decided to do some simple data manipulation using R and use Tableau to present my findings. I chose to use Tableau because of it's interactive dashboard that presents my findings in a visually appealing and fun way. 

## What did I learn?
Through this project, I learned how to clean, validate and manipulate data using R and make interactive Tableau dashboards. 

## Limitations
Some limitations include:
- This index does not account for the GDP in different countries. It is a raw index purely based on Netflix subscription rates and country exchange rates. 
- Data is not dynamic. It is from December 2021.
